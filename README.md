# mini_calculator
This is a preview of a mini calculator that 
I made for practising with Python and Tkinter 
(a GUI library).

Is red and I think is cool. At the moment,
it can only do basic math, but I may add 
some more features in the future, like
adding desploiment on the screen to be
able to see a long operation.

Hope you like my first project! :D
