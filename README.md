# MiniCalculator v0.5

This is a preview of a mini calculator that 
I made for practising with Python and Tkinter 
(a GUI library).

It's red and I think it's cool. At the moment,
it can only do basic math, but I may add 
some more features in the future, like
adding desploiment on the screen to be
able to see a long operation.

Hope you like my first project! :D

-----------------------------------------

# Use

You can use the program with your keyboard
or click the buttons in the window:

  1. Type the first number
  2. Choose the operator
  3. Type the second number
  4. Press "=" or <Enter>
  - Then you can add numbers to the result and
    do another operation (go back to step 2)
  - Press "C" or <Backspace> to erase all.
  - Press <Escape> key to quit.
